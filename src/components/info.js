      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        This site was created as a Fullstack Academy project by a group of dude
        looking to sell meat online. The creators are Tony, Michael, James, and
        PJ, also known as "Tony and the Bolognas".
      </p>
      <h1>The Backstory</h1>
      <p>
        The fake company's roots can be traced back to as early as April 2022
        when four dudes were paired into a group together and forced to pick a
        topic for their capstone project. Their first goal was to pick a group
        name. Naturally, the only appropriate name was Tony and the Bolognas.
        The group then needed to decide on a product to sell online while
        building an ecommerce style website. Instead, the 4 made jokes and came
        up with outlandish products to sell. One of the jokes, was to "sell meat
        online". Before they knew it, time was up in the class and it was time
        to present. The group had to commit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the group Tony and the Bolognas began their project to sell meat
        online.
